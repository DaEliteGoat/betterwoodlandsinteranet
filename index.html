          <li>I will only access porn with my own login and password, which I will broadcast to the whole school;</li>
          <li>I will open other people's files, especially if they are incriminating;</li>
          <li>I will only use the computers for school work and homework, but really, who does that?</li>
          <li>I will not bring in USB sticks or other forms of data storage from outside school unless I have been given permission or maybe I'll do it regardless;</li>
          <li>I will ask permission from a member of staff before using the Internet (yeah right);</li>
          <li>I will only e-mail people I know, or my teacher has approved. Oh come on, what the shit?</li>
          <li>The messages I send will be mainly nudes;</li>
          <li>I will give my home address or telephone number, or arrange to meet someone, regardless of whether my parent, carer or teacher has given permission;</li>
          <li>I will masturbate to any unpleasant material or messages sent to me. I&nbsp;understand my   report would be confidential and would help protect other pupils and myself;</li>
          <li>I understand that the school may check my fetishes and may look at the porn sites I visit.</li>
